// State a mod's rules keep that 3.1c's records have no room for, such as the
// tick each unit slot may be reused at or the facing of each building.
//
// A rule that needs such state keeps it in a table of its own module,
// allocated when the match is built, never in Unit, Game or Player, whose
// layouts are pinned. It adds the table to the match's RuleState while the
// match is built (Match::rule_state), and only when its parameters need the
// state: at its 3.1c baseline a rule adds none. The match then digests every
// table into its state digest and its trace, and a save keeps each one
// (Match::fold_rule_state). With no table added and no mutator digest, nothing
// is digested or saved beyond 3.1c's state, so a match without a profile, or
// with every rule at its baseline, digests exactly as before. A mutator digest
// the match holds is folded even when no table was added.
